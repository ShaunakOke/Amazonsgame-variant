# Amazonsgame-variant(finished)
An amazons game played on a smaller board programmed using killer heuristic history heuristic and alpha beta

Initial state and game board is built. 

User input has been interpret. collisions are fixed

Program input has been decided.

End state has been detected

Smarter moves have been created with killer heuristic

Project over.

You can vary value of variable "actual" to set the depth. But killer heuristic will work only for depth 3 and lower.

Set killer flag to set whether you want standard alpha beta or ab with Killer heuristic.
